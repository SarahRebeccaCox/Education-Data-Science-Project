Frames are shitty I think rhymes better, you guys agree?
Maybe try the LTT forums or tweet @linustechtips (I think)?
If you are thinking of selling this it might be worth sending a sample of this or a later design to say Jayz Two Cents (he does lots of water cooling, Linus Tech Tips, Tech Syndicate or one of the other big tech channels. I realise now I am probably stating the obvious bc you don't build a custom PC case when you aren't that interested in tech (I hope anyway!?!). Thought I'd put it out there and try to help this awesome little case that I probs would buy if it weren't for the bloody Australian dollar!
We outlawed slavery in the Empire by 1884 and it didn't take a civil war. So yes, we have the 'goddamn moral highground' because you had to have a civil war to outlaw slavery. You chose to keep using slaves after declaring independence as a country of the "free". 

Only **people** are free in your country, and non-white people were only, according to your laws, **3/5ths** of a person. So I will stride on the goddamn moral high ground.

But I resolve to say that America has progressed and this discrimination would never happen again.

 I wish you a good day sir.
No, but it still happened.
Get Rekt Fine Bros.
CATIA isn't cheap so I fully understand you using freecad. It's your choice, but it looks similar to CATIA.
Is that CATIA, if it is, I applaud you for your choice of CAD software.
It's power supply shouldn't have that big of an issue with it.
If it works fine like you say then its probably OK. Which Pi do you have?
The power draw on that keyboard concerns me for a raspberry pi as it's not that powerful.
They don't however know that single words like that on signs should have capital letters.
You made a misteak eating at a coffee table.
Cold up there is good because then you just put the PC outside undercover and run the cables through the wall, cooling problems solved. Doesn't matter that you could potentially break the components if they get too cold.
Do you think that Space Research and Environmental Conservation funding should be a priority for the USA or something else like; more effective healthcare and social security?
If I slightly fits, I definitely sits
Probable Cause:
"A reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person's belief that certain facts are probably true" - Wikipedia

Stretching this means that you could probably be under surveillance and they can [probably] do something about it.

Edit: Movies aren't always the best source of info, neither is Wikipedia but it is still more reliable in most cases.
Eagle eye over here
I knew that Feebee didn't look right.
When the baby is born definitely! For the announcement you could use the scene from season 4 episode 9-15 (I can't remember which) of everyone hugging Feebee. 

I think the episode when I look back was The one with the Embryos.
If you want a good example look at TOS or TNG and maybe DS9. But Voyager is like a gateway drug to the rest of the franchise.
"Doesn't even like" and didn't bother to watch more than one or two episodes of I believe Voyager of all things. 

I don't mean hate on Voyager it is my 3rd favourite but it is not the best representation of trek.
Doesn't apply in Australia because everything tech wise here is so damned expensive in comparison to what you get paid.
I am so jealous that you can get game pricing in pesos whereas in Australia we only get USD!
Indentation was being finicky and unlike python lua doesn't require indentation and is period deaf (doesn't require new lines for function/loops and the like). But indentation makes code easier to read so I agree, if you are going to sin, sin right people!
