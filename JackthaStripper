Depends on the pocket knife. If it's a swiss army knife, R1 and R2 both are a literal stomp to me; I'd get some minor cuts on my legs.

If it's something like a ZT 0350 I'd still take it 8/10, but I'd likely need some serious medical attention afterwards, and may permanently lose some feeling or range of motion in my legs.
Oh come on it was a catchweight fight.
I don't think most of the people in this bar realise how close this fight is. Round 1 to McGregor IMO though.
Joanna Jedrejczyk vs Valerie Letornou was much bettet IMO. This one was an emotional roller-coaster though.
Holy shit that just happened
Only if you're a dopey cunt 😙😙
I would.
So cute
Because not all fights are exciting all the time and those guys are higher in the rankings.
Both guys had very good boxing, and while it might be boring AF, wrestlefucking someone isn't easy.
How good the Hitachi magic wand is.
Truuue. Out of the loop. I don't know anything about these dudes.
Yeah definitely. I especially like Lawlor's style. 
Good head movement from Lawlor. Both dudes need to mix it up though!
It's like a bad boxing match...
Cauliflower ears from wrestling. The cartilage gets damaged and suppurates and swells up. If it's not drained within like, 24 hours it gets all fucked up.
P4p cutest fighter
😍😍😍 Joanna
They both do.
Smarter footwork from Nunes, IMO
I'd probably riot.
Fuck what you heard, it's what you hearin', listen
I think it's pretty disrespectful.
It's definitely my favorite. Funny, friendly dudes and fight stuff. What's not to like?
Ehhhh true. I always love seeing a textbook striker even if it's against someone who can't be quite as competitive. Silva is a hitter tho
