Disgustingly soft because in the winter they're heaven but in the summer they make you long for the sweet release of death.
It probably helps that my sheets are disgustingly soft. I'm not sure it would be nearly as enjoyable on normal sheets.
I started sleeping naked four or five years ago and I never went back. 
And now, ten years later, Emperor Thaurissan has become famous again. Even if everyone knows him as Emperor Balanced now.
Thank god. Maybe now /new will stop being flooded with "DAE Urgot rework?" posts.

Fourth, actually. Kalista's ult just knocks up, it doesn't do damage. Interesting observation though!

Joe Miller and Deman both left Riot to work for ESL after last season. That's why neither of them were casting during the Spring Split either.
Sometimes nexus turrets get a bug where the sound of their laser continues to go even when it's not firing. That might be what you were hearing.
But dude! The other guy totally looks like Urgot and I'm the only one that noticed this!
Man, his ult sure has a short cooldown.
The ability to put any champion in the middle of the enemy team would be broken as fuck. It's balanced by the fact that that person also has to be your support throughout all of lane phase.

I don't know if /r/summonerschool is exactly what you're looking for, but it's basically a place for lower tier players to ask questions and higher tier players to share tips and advice.
Ctrl+5 does it I believe.
Honestly I'm starting to think that only happened because BJK took pity on them.
None of the above. It's time to bring back the Rain Man.
"Is this a mid Cassio or a top Cassio? Supprt Lulu or mid Lulu? Jungler or top running smite? Sure wish I could ask them."
Bang's one of SKT's main damage sources and he lost around 7 seconds of damage on a baron that then got stolen. That's a pretty big impact imo.
Riot said that if there was a pentakill or baron steal at MSI the chance of getting a legendary or Esports skin from mystery gift would be doubled. So basically, get a mystery gift in the next few days and you have higher odds of getting something cool.
The fact that that gif has been posted at least 10 times in every post-match thread involving a Hecarim is a level of meta that I wasn't quite prepared for.
&gt; It's not any new problems happening with TSM this is how they always perform.

I mean they won the last international tournament before this one so I don't think it's really fair to fall back on the old "NA &lt; All other regions" argument anymore or say that this is consistent with what we've seen TSM is capable of.
SKT wasn't content to just Bang TSM up the ass. They had to go for the double penetration.
Thank you for waiting to post this in the post-match thread instead of being one of the at least three people posting that link as a submission during the game.
