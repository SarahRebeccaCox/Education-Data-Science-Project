I love my transition lenses! They are so convenient and cheaper for someone with an 8+ prescription. I wish that they'd go darker though because in Australia it can get quite bright.
That shall be on the roof of the weights room
I forgot to add the demographic on the end but this is for all
This is a survey to find out about people's habits when it comes to physical activity. If you could fill it out please it would help me a bunch. It is for an assignment in which I have to design a sport and recreation centre.
So if I where to get a 12 core CPU and just use say a r9 270 that would be better than say 2x 4gb 960s? I can see where you are coming from but wouldn't a graphics card be better at the calculations?
Is he saying that the Soviets came up with the metric system? If you are, I raise my cup of tea to you for coming to the same conclusion that we brits have.
Well took me a few seconds but, would never of guessed! (That was sarcasm because it is hard to imply a tone of voice on the internet using text)
Get a 3 way monitor stand that mounts your desk or just sits on it with 1 base and but the speakers below the 2 outer monitors. You could put the speakers on their side and if they are still too tall the cut into your desk and gheto yourself a holder for them in the desk.
Well you should probably say you are from England (or if you are from NI, Wales or Scotland say them instead) and if they don't know where that is point them here:

It is a video by CGP Grey and explains the difference between England, Britain and the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).
Cool, did not know that. NSFW content should all go to /r/StarTrekAfterDark.

Problem solved (though this is a suggestion and should not be taken as me insisting this be the case)
Maybe a new subreddit for NSFW content like /r/treknoNSFWbabble unless this already exists.
Haven't we already passed the fad of fingerprint scanning for computer access. It's not like the has CIA to cut of your to get into your computer but it would be cheaper and easier for them. The position of it means that the poor bugger with your finger now has to contend with the blood on the trackpad.
Because it runs windows it means you can also have the Microsoft Office Suite and I have found I can run Autodesk Inventor and CATIA (v5) quite well on the Surface Pro 1.
Before you buy consider the Surface Pro line. Just hear me out. I have an original surface pro and it cost me a bit but it is worth it. As a student you don't have much space on the desk in lectures (At least in Australia). The Surface Pro is both a laptop and tablet. It has the ability to have mice and keyboards hooked up. It also runs full windows 8.1 and has USB ports. It is like the Rolls Royce of tablets. But if a Pro 2 or Pro 3 is out of your price range consider an Asus transformer. There are Windows and Android ones available and they are quite cheap.
Malaysia Airlines again?
Obsolete Bitcoin? There is a huge difference between the way square space works and the way Bitcoin works. Trust me, it is not going to make Bitcoin obsolete.
Great work. It all seems to be based in a retro era and I like that. Even if it's not that's how I interpret it and it looks really cool. You should sell this stuff.
"100 million people use Gmail every day."
100 million people could buy a Mac, doesn't mean they're good it just means those 100 million people are complete idiots.
