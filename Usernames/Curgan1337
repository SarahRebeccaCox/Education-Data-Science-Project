Danny Trejo is awesome, in one interview he said something to the effect of: "I don't do any of my own stunts because that takes food off a working man's table and for what? To tell everyone I got big nuts?" Such a legit dude.
I don't think that person was saying there is anything wrong with it just that it breaks immersion, which to be fair it does. I use fast travel all the time in order to accomplish more in the games but I can see the draw some have with not using it.
It is still a valid point and something OP may wish to know, I think it is a cool name personally.
I will always upvote Yuengling.
That is a bit  hyperbolic, it is more like:

"Hi."

"I'm busy." or "I have a boyfriend."
Oh for sure, I definitely see where you are coming from and largely agree. I think this reddit circlejerk of men having it worse is silly. I wouldn't judge any group as necessarily worse, just different on many shitty levels. We all have our own problems and maybe I am a bit optimistic but I would rather think many of the views expressed are just venting because you couldn't say it in real life without looking overly invested/crazy. Reddit is pretty polarized, I will say that, rarely do I catch a moderate opinion, it is usually conservatives calling progressives libtards and progressives calling conservatives backwards bigots. It all gets so silly some times and I hope people take a step back from time to time. I'm not sure where I was going with that but I appreciate the discourse.
If you could point me to those herbs I may be able to check the resources I have at hand and offer a more pointed response. I can say that many various drugs are tested being administered in pill form to attempt to degenerate male fertility but as of now nothing comes close to being as effective as hormonal birth control pills for women. Yes there are compounds of all kinds that reduce sperm count/motility/viability but not to the point they could prevent pregnancy with near guaranteed success.
I will politely agree to disagree on this. I have a close male friend that was blackmailed with threats of rape, he moved across the country and went dark for 9 months, a guy I talked to every week had to disappear and restart his life. Another even closer friend actually had the girl go to the cops with a false accusation, thankfully he wasn't charged and before they did he had evidence her claims were false. Ya, I could see how you would FEEL it doesn't happen in numbers guys say in does but it my sincere opinion, so fucking what. It only takes 1 to ruin you. The first guy is happy and back to normal, happy for him. The other, she killed a part of him that Saturday night and there is no bringing it back.

I feel current punishments are sufficient if they are actually met out instead of handing out a slap on the wrist. Just my 2 cents.
That actually makes a lot of sense and was something I always wondered about. This is a much finer line to tread than I had initially thought.
As a Pharmacology graduate student, it is harder than you think and drugs are being tested on that front. There is a treatment on the horizon that some feel is promising but currently needs more study data. It is basically a compound injected into your vas deferens that blocks the flow of sperm. It is reversible with another injection that dissolves the compound. Tests are being done to insure that it is effectively reversed iirc.
Steel Reserve is surprisingly good for the price I have to say.
Your hangout ideas are on point and I would honestly recommend both men and women consider them.
I don't know why this comment was downvoted, fuck you for being open about what you wrote I guess.
Also a guy, when you say 
&gt;approach a girl

do you mean out of the blue? That may not go over so well but if you know her a bit then ya, pretty much that. It can be a crap shoot if she is a complete stranger but as long as you can take a rejection politely I say go for it.
I mean, there is a lot of wiggle room with it. I personally don't mind going out with a girl and her friends but it would need to be conveyed that it was more than a "just friends" thing. The easiest way is making it just the 2 of you but as long as it is made known shes interested in a relationship/casual sex with you that is all that matters.
Mmmm, that agnostic cola.
I would suggest /r/gainit first, /r/fitness can get a bit...circlejerky.
Yes, many guys have the same feelings they worry about women having. Ex: Oh, guess I'm doing all the work then. That kind of stuff. Best just to down play it, oh I had a dry spell etc. if he questions you being nervous. I say that for a 1 night stand, if you are going for a serious relationship this is absolutely something that should be discussed prior and how he handles it should give you a good idea about how that relationship will go.
Yes, it drives me crazy when a woman asks me for advice but all she really wants is for me to repeat what she wanted with a deeper voice. If you just want to vent by all means I will gladly listen but don't ask me for advice and do **exactly** what the fuck you were going to before you even heard my suggestions. So frustrating.
Long live the King.

Right in the feels.
I got complimented by a random guy 7 years ago on my hat, wasn't sure if he was messing with me but based on the fact it was one of the few compliments I have ever received from someone not related to me, I have decided to take it as one just to put a point on the board.
Stupid sexy Flanders...
I feel he took the high road and is better for it. Yeah, that would be a solid line though, fuck I would like to know it happened.
&gt; I went and got day drunk with my best friend. 

We've all been there, granted, for many different reasons but we have all been there. Hope you and your bro had a glorious time!
I am honestly torn if I am jealous of your ability to cum to chores or not. I mean ya, it would be nice **but** at the same time, who wants to throw loads while planning what you need in the cheese isle.
