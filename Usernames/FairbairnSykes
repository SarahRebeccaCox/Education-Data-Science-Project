You can get one from an NPC at the Nightgate Inn. It's also pretty easy to sprint past the animals in Bloated Man's Grotto to grab the enchanted one there.
That's a pretty common bug with the thrall spells. I've fixed it by casting a cloak spell. If that doesn't work I've seen recommendations saying that being sent to jail will fix it. 
Are you using a follower? Having a follower seems to interfere with sneak attack bonuses a lot of the time.
You can start Dawnguard as a vampire. They won't start turning you away until a couple of missions in (if you stick with their half of the quest line). 
Yeah,  you need to be a pretty specialized character to find it useful. It's just an unusual enough item that it's worth knowing about. 

The way it increases magicka regen is unique. It modifies a different value than the other magicka regen enchantments. [This write up explains it better than I can](http://theskyrimblog.ning.com/group/glitches/forum/topics/let-s-investigate-the-ring-of-the-erudite?commentId=6452022%3AComment%3A1297911&amp;groupId=6452022%3AGroup%3A277857). 
You pretty much summed things up. One thing worth pointing out is that one of the rings you can get as a vampire has a unique effect that some mage builds might find very useful (the Ring of the Erudite).
Another great write up. That shield charge perk is one of the greatest things in the game. I remember bursting out laughing when I unlocked it for the first time.
I can't remember the episode number, but [spoiler](/s "the part where the one character has that PTSD flashback") made me go "wow, this show is going much deeper then I expected it to".
The colour of the neck cloth.
[B Gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei)
Don't pay too much attention to the synopsis, it pretty seriously misrepresents the show. Instead read a couple of the reviews to get a better idea of what to expect. The show is a quite a departure from the usual ecchi formula (there isn't a harem, the mc is female, and there is actual progression in the main characters' relationship).
I've actually managed to get four at once a few times (I think it was because I grabbed them during a moment of frame rate drop which delayed the item disappearing when picked up). The wikis say that the Slow Time shout can make it easier, but I've never tried it myself.
That's just the normal blue hood though, although combining it with one of the blue Hold Guard sets would probably match well. 
Heh, I'm quite surprised considering I only ever comment every couple months or so. Back on topic; Nazir's Hood is another good one. I always forget it because I never do the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood quest.
Have you ever tried the combination of Solitude Guard Armor and any of the Dark Brotherhood cowls? It's another great look for ranger/assassin characters, with the huge benefit of the cowls counting as light armor (so you get the perk bonuses).
Go into your active effects tab and see if you have a thrall active. That's what was causing the dialogue for me. You can try clearing it a couple different ways. I fixed it by using Flame Cloak (when the flame effect ended the thrall was also cleared), but I've also read that getting sent to jail can work.

Hmm, title character from [Witch Hunter Robin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7/Witch_Hunter_Robin) comes close. Maybe Yuuko from [Dusk Maiden](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12445/Tasogare_Otome_x_Amnesia)? Her clothes aren't a perfect match, but she's got the general aura of darkness. A bunch of the characters from [Strawberry Panic](http://myanimelist.net/anime/855/Strawberry_Panic) have enough lace on their clothes to count, if you can stand the melodrama.
[Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12175/Koi_to_Senkyo_to_Chocolate) perhaps?
[Seirei no Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito) meets all your criteria. It has a lot of mysticism, but it doesn't seem like the kind that would bother you. 
I haven't watched Cossette, but based on its description it sounds like [Gosick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8425/Gosick) has enough similarities that you might want to give it a try.
Based on what you have listed I would be surprised if you weren't aware of them already, but just in case [Black Lagoon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon) and [Hellsing:Ultimate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/777/Hellsing_Ultimate) sound like they would be right up your alley. Basically their entire casts are dark anti-heroes. 
[Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou) is a fun SOL/romance show with a really vibrant art style.
[Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) has a lot of what you are interested in. It has wide variety of interesting, intelligent characters plus a much heavier focus on political/economic schemes and strategies than you might expect from just reading the summary. The world it takes place in is also quite complex, and it becomes more and more developed as the show goes on. It doesn't really have the romantic side of the things that Spice and Wolf did so well, but the character interactions are still very entertaining.
[My Little Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun) and [Mysterious Girlfriend X](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12467/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X) both establish relationships early on. If you don't mind a show being ecchi heavy than [B Gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei) might be one you would like. It doesn't start out as quickly as Sakura Trick, but it definitely goes further and is similarly light-hearted.
This would be an amazing thing for people who love building in this game. I feel like one of the biggest limitations to making good builds is how thick every wall has to be. It makes it hard to have interesting details without scaling up the structure to the point of being too large to really interact with in game.
