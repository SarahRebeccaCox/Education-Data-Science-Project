Stun made more sense when you could survive more than a couple hits, nowadays in G rank you either die or get stunned from chip damage.
I believe you need the Felyne skill to give you stronger kicks to kick someone out of paralysis.
I've noticed this effect before on other high-focus games and I assume its just that when you're heavily focused on the game your perception of time seems to slow down (of course, your short term time perception may be slowed, but somehow your long term perception is sped up, hence the "omg what do you mean its 4AM" effect)

I get this with racing games as well.
Note that Gypceros will always take Flash Bombs if you have them, they're basically his version of Felvine. You can't get them back though ;_;
Fun fact, there was a movement of so called shirtless people.

It just uhh, was in support of a military junta. 

They called themselves Descamisados.

I lived in Belgium for a year, my number one food takeaway was that Curry Ketchup is godlike on fries. Seriously, just the thought of it is making me hungry...
Autotracker is like my life! I'm currently HR5/Caravan 10 and my Velociprey set with Auto tracker, Attack Up XL, and halve stun had been the perfect general set. Never worrying about having to re-paint or wonder where the Unstable enemy spawns are is such a help.

And on that note Halve Stun makes it so I almost never get stunned, thus saving me from the horror of combo carts. 10/10 would recommend. 

The netcode is garbage. Why the hell does Coil have so many movement coordination mechanics in a game that has highly obvious synchronization delay with player movement!? Plus enemies take their sweet time moving when they aggro swap as well. The buff delay is the other obvious issue, wherein a buff/debuff on a target doesn't take immediate effect. This is most obvious when dealing with tank buster mechanics and using shields or defensive buffs, and ground AOEs are another obvious point. Add the whole "macros don't allow ability queueing" thing and the game just feels clunky as shit.

And don't even get me started on just the tiny stupid shit SE does. like adding an infinite source of sands/twines in hunts while leaving the weekly capped source as oil/coat for another month or so, and the fact that everything is blocked behind grinds or RNG. Like Christ, can not even some shit like TT stand on its own merits? Or must we grind everything to make sure we can't saturate our fun. 

I love FFXIV to death but wow, some of this is just bad.
A literal translation is generally no better than no translation, so a lot of times translations will be localized to the target region to try to aim for a similar effect to what the original title has on its region. Some are bad localizations, but excepting the Home Alone one and the movies I haven't seen in that list I can easily believe those translations are pretty alright.
Rank 4 cards exchange for 200 MGP (just checked with my spare "Alphaniud &amp; Alisae" card)
If you recall some of the cutscenes of the Ascian's hanging out in a physical room talking to each other, and look closely at the picture OP posted you may notice that the GM jail is the area the Ascian's were meeting in!

GM's confirmed for Ascians!
If you aren't concerned with the beauty levels of the area, concrete flooring is a cheap way to keep an area clear of trees.

But but but Nascar is just driving in circles!! How can anyone watch that!?

Not with that attitude you can't!
True, I forgot about that. But that's certainly the exception rather than the rule.
I mean by that logic Starcraft is turn based just with turns that last around 1/60 of a second! :)
I can't agree with that because one of the core aspects of Turn-Based Strategy is asynchronous player input, that is to say in a multiplayer game, only one player can give instructions to the game world at a time.

 The one day and one hour systems are just to root the calculation cycles of the maths the game has to do in all of its simulations. It just uses a set time delay (depending on the games current speed) to prevent itself from having to recalculate the world state on every CPU cycle (every game does this calculation delay for things that don't need to be recalculated on every frame, it's just more visible in these ones).
Shhh you're spoiling the fun :D
Doitsu means Germany in Japanese, so clearly it's "This guy, that guy, and Germany" :)
I only mentioned the TBS vs RTS thing cause you pointed it out for Sins, but I agree that it's hardly relevant to the GSG vs 4X part. I just find it hard to say that Hearts of Iron or CK are 4X when you look at the explanation of the four terms:

&gt;Explore means players send scouts across a map to reveal surrounding territories.

&gt;Expand means players claim new territory by creating new settlements, or sometimes by extending the influence of existing settlements.

&gt;Exploit means players gather and use resources in areas they control, and improve the efficiency of that usage.

&gt;Exterminate means attacking and eliminating rival players. Since in some games all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence may be the only way to achieve further expansion.

Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron don't fit the first two at all. As far as Paradox games go the colonization side of Europe Universalis does get pretty close to 4X though.
Minor note, but a lot of strategy fans would consider the Hearts of Iron series and the Crusader Kings series to be not 4X but rather "Grand Strategy". The key difference is that there's no "explore" in the listed titles, and are instead based around pre-made world maps where the player joins a so-to-speak "in-progress" world. Also the two listed series are also Real Time Strategy, rather than Turn Based.
I guess I would consider that "more or less" difference to be *kind of important* when discussing whether a drug is safe for a certain individual or type of individual. 

From the way you describe it and from the way I and others with ADHD would describe it  you seem to be feeling the "more" which would definitely paint a bad picture of the drug, despite the fact that most people with ADHD will feel something more akin to the "less".
I have ADHD, I take stimulants, trust me when I say I know what effect they have on me. And again, there's no paradoxical effect as I described it, it has the same core effect on everyone. It's like multiplication, I can take two numbers and multiply them by the same number, and if the starting numbers are different the end numbers will vastly different. Or to put that another way, if you apply a modifier to two different bases the end result will obviously different.
The root effect of the stimulant is of course the same in ADHD and non-ADHD users, in the way that it effects the chemical receptors in the brain, but it's the perceived effects (how the user feels those changes) that differ. 

That's just the nature of psychoactive drugs, people react differently to them depending on a large variety of factors, and whether someone has a diagnosable psychological disorder (and therefore has whatever physical brain differences are associated with it) is one of those factors.
I sort of did that once back in the Levi-EX days, there was a farm party in PF that waited at 7/8 for over 15 minutes looking for a PLD. I  knew the fight to about 20% and so when I joined I immediately explained my experience level and reasoning in party chat, and the party agreed that they were fine with it. We then cleared it with only one wipe (Unsurprisingly, a farm's group DPS on the add that needs to be stunned was slightly higher than a learning groups).

It's almost like being honest and upfront can earn you goodwill and help you out! :D
