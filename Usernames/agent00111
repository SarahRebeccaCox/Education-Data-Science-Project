D4, full title: "D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die" is an XBOX One game about a detective who can travel back in time. It's from the same producer as Deadly Premonition.
I liked his Heavy Rain and D4 series a lot.
Are the game results even correct?
Never expected that of him, not that I mind at all!
I assume you live in the USA?
They might be biologically, but not socially. They are women.
Not everyone who's supportive of trans people is a SJW
Actually the tits are often real. They take female hormones and go through puberty just like girls, which include growing tits.


On a side note, it's not really respectful to call them dudes if they identify as female.
Isn't "take it like a man" more about boy vs. man instead of woman vs. man?
On my phone (Samsung Galaxy Core) it's actually really nice.
Well that's a bummer. 

But it's going to look more or less like [this](http://www.wikipedy.com/images_p/p_3/pupa.jpg) when it's pupated during metamorphosis?
I was wondering that as well, I think so.
&gt;Featuring the return of the Nykur!

What videos has he been in before?
A few episodes he did mention there were two additional levels he didn't know about though.
No Rainbow Ride then? : (

I think it was the same girl. She also yelled "Ze" before. Damn, why would anyone even say that? What kind of response did she expect?
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
Same here. Only three friends know, who like anime as well. 

One of them is the stereotypical weeaboo who thinks he can speak Japanese and wants to live in Japan, expecting it to be the same as an anime-con. Funnily enough, he's watched the fewest anime of all of us. 
Damn it, it seemed like it would've been a great addition to the series.

Majora's Mask.

No game, that I know of, has been able to work with the concept of time and travelling back through it, whilst keeping the same stories going on at the same time without getting boring just like Majora's Mask has.

I felt so terrible when I had completed a story which improved someone's life, just to reset time and keep them unhappy in order to get all the masks, only being able to help a few on the last time line before saving the town.
I agree, but I'd put Majora's Mask above it in artistic value because of originality.

To put bath bombs in.
