I once worked in a research lab that used a fly model for studying sensitivity to pain. There are subsets of neurons clearly dedicated to sensing tissue damage (nociception) like there are in humans. The related and perhaps more important question, is do insects suffer (the subjectice experience of emotional upset and sense of potential loss). That, I can't answer, but I wouldn't expect so... insects are not known for having rich and complex emotional lives. Though, not being an insect, it's hard to say!
What kind of injury are you giving the mice to evaluate their pain response? That might help narrow down what kind of assay to suggest. As far as I know, there are no blood-based or imaging based techniques for evaluating the experience of pain - the phenomena of pain is largely confined to the nervous system, as its primary purpose is to modify current and future behavior related to injury or potential injury. The use of fMRI to study pain is recent [(check this paper)](http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/files/papers/Wager_2013_NEJM.pdf). Maybe you could use some sort of hormonal signal indicating stress - [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2007.09.006) might have some good leads - but that could easily be confounded as well by animal handling, housing, variability in wounding, etc.

If you have access to the equipment and expertise, current clamp electrophysiology evaluating action potential firing rate in relevant primary sensory neurons seems to be a good correlate of the subjective experience of heightened sensitivity after injury or in chronic pain. [This paper](http://www.molecularpain.com/content/5/1/18) discusses a few different electrophysiological techniques along with the traditional behavioral assay (von Frey filament withdrawal thresholds). Obviously the major downside is that electrophysiology is impossible to utilize in humans, short of working with a neurosurgeon performing a radiculectomy and collecting that tissue for single cell recording.
From the report I linked, it looks like in 2009 5634 were enrolled under the top ten percent rule, and 946 under the alternate with 6580 enrolled overall. So that's about 85.5% enrolled. Presumably this reflects admissions to some degree, though I freely admit I do not have data about percent admission. However, the first page details the HB588 law and indicates that 

"For Entering 2009 and 2010 the Texas Top 10% Law (HB 588 of the 1997 Regular Session) required the automatic
admission of any student graduating in the top 10% of an accredited Texas high school. Automatic admissions
for Entering 2011 will be governed by the provisions of SB 175 of the 2009 Regular Session. "

The new law states that the university is only obligated to fill 75% of its incoming student body with automatic admissions, however the 2010 data also reflects about an 85% admission from this student pool.

I was attending UT Austin when this case was first taken to the Supreme Court.  Part of what is often lost in this discussion is that UT Austin's primary admissions policy is the top 10% rule (though now it is some other percentage - it gets more restrictive each year because of the number of students in the state). The large majority of admissions to the university are to students who are in the top 10% of their high school class, with a certain SAT/ACT score. This policy is actually, in my mind, the main driver of equality of admissions while still maintaining a meritocratic admissions policy. You essentially are competing with individuals in roughly the same situation as you, rather than students from more elite high schools with far more resources and prestige that can accumulate admissions garnishes and may have better educational and economic backgrounds which, as is commonly accepted, help drive your own academic success.


Abigail Fischer did not meet this criteria at her own high school, and thus was applying with hopes that her GPA, scores, and extracurriculars would help her compete for the remaining spots - these are spots allotted for special circumstances that include racial and ethnic considerations. However, I would note that, in fact, a demographically disproportionate percentage of white students are admitted by this route, which to me has made this court case ring hollow.


So, I would agree that there is discrimination in the holistic review process, but not in the direction that the Fischer case implies. However, this admissions process also is responsible only for a minority of students admitted to UT Austin and I am not sure it is due the attention that it has been receiving, as compared to the success of the top 10% rule.

**edit for clarifying my conclusion**
Brain complexity has evolved precisely because it helps organisms endowed with it to rapidly adapt to novel situations... hasn't the selective pressure on complex brains like our own been in favor of adaptive responses, rather than stereotyped behavior?

To me, it seems to be much more difficult to explain significant hard-wiring at a behavioral level between sexes, when the brain in general has developed to be a particularly flexible organ. This especially so, because plasticity provides adequate explanation for observed behavioral differences between the sexes while also allotting for the wide variations we observe.

ninjaedit: I'm not disagreeing that there are differences between the sexes and that they influence brain development differently, but I do feel that there is not nearly enough attention is paid, in the realm of sex-based behavioral differences, to one of the *most important functions of the complex brain*; adaptability.
&gt; Climate change has happened as an accidental result of our a technology which didn't even remotely take into consider its environmental impact. The cost of oil will continue to increase, and the cost of solar will continue to decrease; by 2030 humans will be well along the transition to renewables.

While I fully believe that anthropogenic climate change exists and needs to be combated for own sakes, it is very, very important to remember that *climate change is a natural process*. It has existed before humans, and the earth has experienced temperatures much warmer and much cooler than now. For any proposed geoengineering project, *we must remember that there is NO ideal temperature for Earth*. There are temperatures which we are interested in maintaining because they support our current mode of living, but the effect of maintaining global temperatures may well affect ecosystems and evolutionary patterns in ways we do not understand and, indeed, which I think very few people have considered.

I think makes the question of ceasing the accelerating effect of human-caused climate change far more difficult than the article (or really, most people interested in this topic) anticipate. I am completely for ceasing the noxious, propelling effect humans have on climate change, but I really hope that people investing in these projects choose wisely and promote a lot more research in this topic. 

Hoping to narrow it down to family or genus!
Not everyone who wants to adopt should adopt, you know - and the foster care system is not exactly a pleasant experience for the children in it. I don't think it is right to tell women, who would otherwise have an abortion, to short-circuit their lives to carry a child and spend a lot of money on their healthcare in the meanwhile. Pregnancy isn't just an 'inconvenience' that women should go through.
Maybe this will assuage, just a bit, the hurtful sting of disappointment?

Yeah, its hard to have them accept evolution if they don't even understand it. From his 'lecture', he says that wolves, dogs, and coyotes don't interbreed according to an 'evolutionist' - but they do. There's only partial pre-zygotic reproductive isolation, and wolfdog and coydog hybrids are well-known phenomenon.
