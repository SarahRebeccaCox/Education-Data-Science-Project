For RTO supports/pushups is it better to have forearms in front or behind the rings?

explain?
There's two types of one arm pushups.   Arm in and arm out.  I'm on mobile right now and cant really link to it, but beast skills has it on his website. 
Google works pretty well
In the progression for ["Here"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKp2CrfmVfw) it goes to a diminished chord for the third chord then resolves by bringing the bass down a half step doing from a B natural diminished to a Bb major.  This is fairly common and IMO sounds awesome.

Only 3 reps in this, it was my first time getting it. 
It is
Pretty much everything was edible except the plates. 
It was the wagyu beef and potato. 
The hot potato was there, I just forgot to add the picture.  I actually did it like a shot and spilled all over myself.  Totally worth it. 
I never got that feeling during the meal.  There always was enough of each dish to keep you wanting more from the next, and in most cases it just kept ramping up. 
I think it's 150 more per person. 
I was lucky and got to eat extra meat since one of the people there didnt want their wagyu or duck breast.
