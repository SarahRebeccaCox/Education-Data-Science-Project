Honestly, it sounds more as if you're dealing with sexism and gender roles than transgenderism and gender dysphoria/gender identity disorder. I suggest finding a gender therapist.
For a second I thought (artist) Joe broke the Pit amiibo
Based on what they were born as or identify as?
Basically, how would you indicate transgender people? Don't you also need something to indicate gender (identity) with?

So not just "born male/female" but also "identifies as male/female"
I understand, but would they then have to fill in the one they were born as as well? How would you know they were transgender? Do they not need a seperate choice of the gender they identify with?
But they don't identify with the sex they were born as.
What do you think about transgender people?
D4, full title: "D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die" is an XBOX One game about a detective who can travel back in time. It's from the same producer as Deadly Premonition.
I liked his Heavy Rain and D4 series a lot.
Are the game results even correct?
Never expected that of him, not that I mind at all!
I assume you live in the USA?
They might be biologically, but not socially. They are women.
Not everyone who's supportive of trans people is a SJW
Actually the tits are often real. They take female hormones and go through puberty just like girls, which include growing tits.


On a side note, it's not really respectful to call them dudes if they identify as female.
Isn't "take it like a man" more about boy vs. man instead of woman vs. man?
On my phone (Samsung Galaxy Core) it's actually really nice.
Well that's a bummer. 

But it's going to look more or less like [this](http://www.wikipedy.com/images_p/p_3/pupa.jpg) when it's pupated during metamorphosis?
I was wondering that as well, I think so.

I think it was the same girl. She also yelled "Ze" before. Damn, why would anyone even say that? What kind of response did she expect?
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
