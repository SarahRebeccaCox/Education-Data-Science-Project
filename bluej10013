And people retiring and getting their first jobs.
That was interesting. I wonder how much of agency /actualization / power is a zero-sum game and how much can be Pareto improved.
I wouldn't be surprised if the opposite happens: if the Republican party swings authoritarian with Trump and the Dems make modest overtures to libertarians.
This will help you to be more sophisticatedly confused:

&gt; When we go about the world, we have expectations which are often not fulfilled. For example, Pierre is not at the café where we thought we would meet him, so there is a negation, a void, a nothingness, in the place of Pierre. When looking for Pierre his lack of being there becomes a negation; everything he sees as he searches the people and objects about him are "not Pierre".

&gt; Sartre defines two kinds of "being" (être). One kind is être-en-soi, the brute existence of things such as a tree. The other kind is être-pour-soi which is consciousness. Sartre claims that this second kind of being is "nothing" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence. Sartre, and even more so, Jaques Lacan, use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.

The canonical term for this is [rule utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism), which I think is basically just [utilitarianism with humility](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/).
A good explanation via example is [The Slate Star Codex Political Spectrum Quiz](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/08/the-slate-star-codex-political-spectrum-quiz/).
You certainly could be right, but [Addis Ababa is already sub-replacement fertility](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34732609).
One argument from the [2014 Gates Letter](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/Resources-and-Media/Annual-Letters-List/Annual-Letter-2014#MYTHTHREE) that might change your mind:

&gt; When children survive in greater numbers, parents decide to have smaller families. Consider Thailand. Around 1960, child mortality started going down. Then, around 1970, after the government invested in a strong family planning program, birth rates started to drop. In the course of just two decades, Thai women went from having an average of six children to an average of two.

Also, apparent stagnation could still represent improvement for individuals if there's ongoing brain drain.
Seriously, I had just decided I was done for a while, and then bam, Sunless Sea!

Light casts out dross. Transparency is anti-authoritarian.

I'm no goldbug, but I can understand people's concern.
It would be super interesting to ask half of participants about educating boys and the others about educating girls. 
Do you only have one save slot? A stack or array of saves would be cooler. Ideal would be arbitrary access to a version control tree, as in _Papers, Please_.
Salvia is legal in Utah. It's insane, but I love it. 
I posted this recently:

Sanders [defends Snowden](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/06/snowden-clemency-sanders-nsa/4344467/), [opposed the Freedom Act](http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2015/06/01/bernie-sanders-and-rand-paul-agree-the-nsa-goes-too-far/RB84u3L4NFzvmF9shCGszO/story.html), [opposed CISA](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/cisa-cybersecurity-bill-senate-vote), [supports legalizing marijuana](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sanders-will-propose-nixing-marijuana-from-federal-list-of-dangerous-drugs/2015/10/28/be8c3adc-7da2-11e5-b575-d8dcfedb4ea1_story.html), [opposed the war in Iraq, and opposed the Patriot Act](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2015/sep/02/11-examples-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-hol/). It's easy to criticize him, but it's also easy to find ways in which he fights federal overreach.
This is an excellent summary of his culture concerns and is short enough that I could send it to people without it coming off as "it's not my job to educate you". I think this deserves to be in his recommended posts page.
"he is still born" has a pretty different meaning from "he is stillborn".
I wish the world were as awesome as it is in your head, but [bomb calorimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimeter#Bomb_calorimeters) don't actually explode. They're just called that because they have to hold in high internal pressure from burning things.
Yeah, I was gonna suggest Borderlands. They have character classes specifically designed to be fun for people without FPS skills.
Well, that's among tracked posts, which I don't believe include stuff killed by the knights of /new.

I feel like it would be very easy to overwork a human with a whip, to be fair.
