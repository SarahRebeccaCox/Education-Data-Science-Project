This survey made me feel like I'd done something wrong.
Woah, we both have chromy usernames. It's like we're on a team.
I love Schrab, but I love him paying for his hubris even more.
You're an idiot.
GG is a hate group because of the death threats, rape threats, mass shooting threats and doxxing.

All too often man. I try to bring cool headed feminist ideas into gamergate spaces and the responses can get pretty hostile. 

My analogy for gamergate and the confederate flag is based on the observation that everyone who waves one of those flags is intentionally overlooking decades of systemic racism and thousands of lynchings, implying that they weren't a big deal. In the same way, anyone who identifies with gamergate is intentionally overlooking thousands of cases of death threats, rape threats, mass shooting threats and doxxing that defines gamergate activism. 
Everyone's fine with rational criticisms of censorship, political correctness, or feminism, but identifying with gamergate is like waving a confederate flag. You may claim that it's about heritage, but the vast majority of people waving it are bigoted assholes who just hate black people. 
Pretty typical stuff:

"This is so awesome, I want to get on

Lower the Bridge

I'm flying, I'm flying on the helicopter!

Don't shoot, you'll break it

Can you drive somewhere? I'll stay on the helicopter

You shouldn't have raised the bridge, it jumps the helicopter up and down. You should have drove away somewhere"

The guy's actually VERY whiny. I don't like 'im.
Literature, sure, but these are comments where word economy counts. There are constant misunderstandings in comment threads and this wouldn't be so popular if it didn't work.
A genius.
Now I really want to see the choices that each country makes.
That's been the deal for a while now. They haven't lived with their dad in years. They write all the sketches separately, then they all fly into Arizona to shoot them all at once. Finally, Yngelmo edits and releases them. The editing is apparently the most time consuming part, so the patreon is to support Yngelmo while he does that.

If there's gonna be life is strange ones, they'll have to be next season.
It boils down to nothing interesting happening at any point. Just bland, 2 dimensional characters  dramatically hacking into each other's mainframes for 20 hours.

Gameplay is great though, listen to podcasts while you're playing to substitute the story.
You can get more xp for egg morty if you use a lower level morty to finish off the enemy morty. The bigger the level difference, the more xp. And you can reliably get lvl up seeds from council fights.
You do have to use one to get him to lvl 20 or higher. I used several before I got to 20, but he didn't evolve until I used another one at 20.
Some options:

Booze

Bloom

Poopy (?!)

Clone
Hey, me too. Lvl 20 egg to a lvl 21 OTM.
My main issue with the game is that all of the animations are the same.

If the animations were funny or interesting, it would add a ton of excitement to unlocking new Mortys.
They're tough, but fair. Most mobile games only offer a shallow experience.

I like this game, but their criticisms were valid. They're judging it purely on game mechanics, which really don't hold up against Pokemon.
If he's this open about incest porn, why keep this sponsorship a secret?

I think calling out Pornhub premium is just a bit he's doing.
Yo /u/Katie_Pornhub 

Dan Harmon's doing some good pr for Pornhub at the top of the show. Let's get this harmon promo code going.

She just beat out Mark Hamill and Troy Baker for a voice acting award. I think she's made it.
Damn, nothing worse than getting corrected on a correction.
